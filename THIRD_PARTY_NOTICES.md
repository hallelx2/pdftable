# Third-party notices

pdftable itself is MIT-licensed (see `LICENSE`). It bundles no third-party
*code*, but several generated data tables in `internal/pdf/` are derived from
third-party sources. Those sources and their license terms are reproduced
below.

| File | Derived from | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `internal/pdf/afm_widths.go` | Adobe Core 14 AFM metrics, via ReportLab's `_fontdata_widths_*.py` | BSD-3-Clause |
| `internal/pdf/symbol_glyphs.go` | Adobe Glyph List (`glyphlist.txt`) | BSD-3-Clause |
| `internal/pdf/zapfdingbats_glyphs.go` | Adobe Glyph List (`zapfdingbats.txt`) | BSD-3-Clause |

## Adobe Glyph List (agl-aglfn)

<https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-aglfn>

Source of `glyphlist.txt` and `zapfdingbats.txt`, from which the glyph-name to
Unicode tables and the Symbol / ZapfDingbats built-in encodings were generated.
The Core 14 AFM advance widths originate with Adobe as well.

## ReportLab

<https://github.com/MrBitBucket/reportlab-mirror>

The Core 14 advance widths in `afm_widths.go` were taken from ReportLab's
`reportlab/pdfbase/_fontdata_widths_*.py`, which mirror Adobe's public Core 14
AFM files. ReportLab is distributed under the BSD-3-Clause license,
Copyright (c) 2000-2024, ReportLab Europe Ltd. The full license text ships with
ReportLab as `LICENSE.txt`.

## pdf.js

<https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js>

The Symbol and ZapfDingbats built-in encoding vectors in
`standard14_encodings.go` were generated from the `SymbolSetEncoding` and
`ZapfDingbatsEncoding` arrays in `src/core/encodings.js`.
