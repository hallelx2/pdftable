// finder_bench_test.go pins the performance characteristics of the
// cell-finding pipeline. The dense-grid cases are a regression guard
// against the O(n^2)/O(n^3) blow-up that used to hang the parser for
// minutes on finely-ruled financial-document pages: a fine ruling
// grid with hundreds of vertical + horizontal rulings yields tens of
// thousands of intersections, and the pre-v0.3.1 suffix-rescan cell
// finder was quadratic in that count.
//
// BenchmarkIntersectionsToCellsDenseGrid measures the hot path on a
// 200x200 lattice (40,000 intersections). TestDenseGridTerminates
// Quickly turns the same input into a hard wall-clock assertion so
// CI fails loudly if anyone reintroduces the quadratic behaviour.
